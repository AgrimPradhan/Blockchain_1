Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and immutable way. Each block in the chain contains a set of transactions and is linked to the previous block using cryptographic hashes, forming a continuous chain. Once a block is added to the chain, its data cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks, making it tamper-resistant. Blockchain operates without a central authority, using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake to validate transactions. This technology ensures trust among participants and is commonly used in cryptocurrency, but its use extends far beyond just digital money.

2 Real-Life Use Cases:

Supply Chain Management: Blockchain tracks the journey of products from origin to consumer, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud.
Digital Identity: Users can manage their identity securely, avoiding identity theft and giving control over personal data.

Diagram of a Block:

+----------------------------------+
|           Block Header           |
+----------------------------------+
| Previous Hash: 84a9f1...         |
| Timestamp: 2025-06-08 16:45:10   |
| Nonce: 987654                    |
| Merkle Root: f3a1b2...           |
+----------------------------------+
|           Block Data             |
+----------------------------------+
| - Transaction 1                  |
| - Transaction 2                  |
| - ...                            |
+----------------------------------+
Merkle Root & Data Integrity (Example):
A Merkle root is the hash of all transaction hashes in a block combined in a tree structure. For example, if a block has 4 transactions (T1, T2, T3, T4), hashes are paired and hashed again until one root hash remains. If someone tries to change T2, its hash changes, which changes the parent hash, and ultimately the Merkle root—alerting the system to tampering. This makes it easy to verify whether a transaction is part of a block and ensures data integrity without needing to check the entire block.

=> Consensus Conceptualization
1. What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?
Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The process requires high computational power, which consumes a lot of electricity. This energy-intensive task is essential to secure the network by making it expensive to perform malicious attacks. Only the first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the block and earn a reward.

2. What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they "stake" or lock up as collateral. Unlike PoW, it doesn’t require solving puzzles, so it consumes much less energy. The more coins a user stakes, the higher their chances of being selected to validate transactions and earn rewards, promoting efficiency and environmental sustainability.

3. What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus model where token holders vote for a limited number of delegates (validators) to validate transactions and produce blocks on their behalf. Voting power is usually proportional to the number of tokens held. These elected delegates are rotated periodically and are responsible for maintaining the network. DPoS enhances speed and scalability but relies more on trust in the elected validators.
